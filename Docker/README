The following is a simple example algorithm.

It is meant to run within a container.

To run it locally, you can call the following bash script:

bash test_run.sh

This will start the inference and reads from ./test/input and outputs to ./test/output

To export the container and prep it for upload to Grand-Challenge.org you can call:

  docker save example-algorithm-phase-1 | gzip -c > example-algorithm-phase-1.tar.gz

Any container that shows the same behavior will do, this is purely an example of how one COULD do it.
